If you're drawing art, you're probably having some fun sharing it with people, online or not. But don't fall into the trap of drawing just for an audience!

I'll get right to it. You should be weird, draw weird things, and make things that make you happy. Maybe that's what you already draw! Great. But if there's something that you've been avoiding drawing because you're not sure if people will like it... you should draw that thing. See if *you* like it!

Maybe you've started out drawing fanart of your favorite video game, and have met some people in that community and shared a bunch of art. Don't feel like you have to stick to that! If you want to draw something else too, draw it! It's your art and you don't owe anything to an audience just because that's what you drew first. Branch out! Draw those things that you want to draw and you'll also likely develop some new skills while doing so. You can still come back to other art later!

If the thought of drawing something makes you feel embarrassed, that just means that you should totally try it! You do **not** need to share it with **anyone** if you don't want to! Your art is your safe space. Wanna draw something from that guilty pleasure TV show that you don't tell your friends about? Do it. Wanna ship some characters you've been thinking about? Do it. Be UNHINGED.

You can go eeeven further. Yep, I'm saying what you're thinking. If you're an adult, and you've thought about drawing adult things, just GO for it! Draw a (censored) and they're all just (oh goodness) but (censored) at all. Draw something that makes you blush.

Remember, you can and should have your own private sketchbook. You can keep these drawings in there and keep them hidden away. But don't hide from yourself. See you back here next time!
