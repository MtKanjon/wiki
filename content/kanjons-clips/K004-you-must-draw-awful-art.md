Many people will provide some advice to beginner artists that sounds something like this: "Oh it's OK if not every drawing comes out well, you can always try again and learn from it!" And whenever someone says that I'm like, yeah, okay. But deep down we know that it doesn't always feel ok. And it's hard to get past that!

I'm here to take a much more aggressive stance: you MUST draw shitty terrible awful drawings to get to the good ones. It's not an option. It's not an accident or a fluke. It's a requirement: make a bunch of terrible art, and then you can start to make good art. Use cheap paper, don't even bother with a sketchbook.

When you're first starting out, you're going to be making a lot of awful drawings, and that's part of the assignment. Draw them. Laugh at them. Share them and keep them, or throw them out. Apart from just practicing, when you notice that your art is bad, then it means you've begun to train your eye to recognize good and bad art -- this is good! Having an eye for good art is how you set your goals and improve.

This even applies on a daily basis! You have to get those shitty drawings out of the way, first thing, before you can draw what you want to draw. Warming up is not some optional activity: it's the process of doing those terrible drawings so that you can get yourself ready to make good ones.
As you progress through your skill over months and years, you might find that you don't need to make as many shitty drawings before you can start your masterpieces. That's how skill works!

Because you can't gain an eye for good art until you've made some true dumpster fires.
