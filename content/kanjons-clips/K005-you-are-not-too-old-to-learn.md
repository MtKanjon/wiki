You're not too old for art, dummy!

It's very common to hear people be uncertain about whether it's too late to start art. You'll hear people in their: Seventies. Thirties. Forties. TWENTIES! Say that they think it's too late for them to be an artist. I've even heard an EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD worry about how they "missed out" because they didn't start drawing younger.

I started art in my late 20s, and didn't really practice things consistently until I was 30! Maybe folks they think that they missed the age for art school. Surprise: you don't need art school to learn to draw. "But everyone else started so young, how will I ever catch up?" Who cares? You're starting now.

Look. I used to struggle with these thoughts too, and I don't expect you to watch this video and go "thanks I'm all better now!" But you repeat this stuff to yourself often enough, and you start to get more comfortable with your art, and you'll stop caring about how far along you are compared to others. It's OK if you need to bookmark this video to remind yourself every so often.

Art is a lifetime skill that you can improve on forever! There's very few skills out there like that. That's exciting! And there's no age when art "stops". So, as best as you can, stop hesitating, and start learning.
