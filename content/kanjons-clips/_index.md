Kanjon's Clips is my video series of short, motivation-focused art tips designed to keep you drawing. Find the full playlist at [kanjon.link/clips](https://kanjon.link/clips), or browse through here.

I've put together this wiki to house the occasional extra resources, as well as to provide a less-distracting way to poke through the content. But the choice of where you watch is up to you!
